# project_euler

My Project Euler problem solutions. Written in a few languages with code to help run them on file save.


## Running Problems
1. Make sure you have `nodemon` installed.
    - `npm install -g nodemon`
2. Rerun problems with `npm run euler -- PROBLEM_NUMER LANGUAGE`
    - Example: `npm run euler -- 1 c`
